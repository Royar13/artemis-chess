# Artemis Chess
A Chess engine written in C#.

Its main features are:
* Bitboards board representation
* Principal Variation Search (PVS)
* Quiescence Search
* Transposition Table
* Killer Heuristic
* A user interface to play against the engine

It is still a work in progress, and there are many features I hope to add in the future, such as advanced pruning techniques
and improvements to the evaluation method.
