# Artemis Chess
A Chess engine written in C#.

Its main features are:
* Bitboards board representation

## Future Goals
This is still a work in progress, and there are many features I still want to add. The main ones are:
* Threefold repetition and 50-move rule
* UCI/XBoard support
* Integration with a Chess server such as FICS
* Advanced pruning techniques
* Improvements and tuning of the evaluation function
* Time management logic
